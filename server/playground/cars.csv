focus,"Great car, I am simply selling it as it doesn't suit my needs anymore. Owned for a year and have had no breakdowns. It has served me very well and has been used for many road trips. The back seats fold down and allow a lot of space. The CD player works perfectly and also has an auxiliary port, along with all working speakers. As brilliant as this car is, it does need a few tweaks. Aesthetic issues include : gear knob, rear view mirror, small patches of exterior rust, small paintwork damage. It starts and runs perfectly, however it does seem to have a slightly sticky throttle and a slightly squeaky fan belt. The knobs for the side mirrors do not work but the mirrors are in perfect working order. The dial to direct the fan is stuck on windscreen.
